# Beat Labs Builds (for Oculus Quest)

## What is Beat Labs?

Beat Labs is a free and open sandbox for fiddling with different gameplay mechanics and ideas for rhythm games in VR. It’s powered by BeatSaver - a database of over 70 000 community-made song beatmaps for Beat Saber.

It currently focuses on the mechanics of Beat Saber but eventually there will be various modifications to the way the game feels and plays.

We’re doing it in the open so [come and join the discussion on our Discord](https://dsc.gg/beatlabs?ref=gh)!
